# Google Play Store Apps Analysis

This project dives into a dataset of Google Play Store apps to uncover patterns in **categories, ratings, installs, reviews, and pricing**.

It’s not just about crunching numbers — it’s about understanding what makes an app successful.



I built this project as part of my **learning journey in data analysis**, while also practicing **real-world Git \& GitHub workflows** for version control and collaboration.



## What I Did

* **Cleaned messy data**: Fixed missing values, corrected data types, and formatted columns for analysis.



* **Explored the dataset**: Looked at category trends, app ratings, review counts, and installs.



* **Visualized insights**: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clear, informative charts.



* **Extracted key insights**: Identified top-rated categories, most-reviewed apps, and interesting pricing patterns.



## Skills \& Tools

* **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn



* **Version Control**: Git \& GitHub



* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook



## Why This Project?

I wanted to **strengthen my skills in data analysis** while also gaining hands-on experience with **Git and GitHub** — tools used by real data teams.

This project serves as both a portfolio piece and a **personal milestone** in my journey as a data enthusiast.
