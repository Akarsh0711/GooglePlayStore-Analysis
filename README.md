# **Exploring the Google Play Store: What Makes Apps Successful?**

Have you ever scrolled through the Play Store and wondered:

Why do some apps skyrocket to millions of downloads while others stay unnoticed?

Do bigger apps with more features get better ratings?

Are paid apps really worth it?



I had the same questions — so I decided to dig into the numbers.



## **The Journey**

This project started as a personal challenge: I wanted to **analyze real-world app data** and uncover insights that developers, marketers, or even curious users could find useful.



Using a **dataset of over 10,000 Google Play Store apps**, I explored everything from app categories and ratings to **installs, reviews, and pricing models**. Along the way, I cleaned messy data, visualized patterns, and asked the questions that matter.



## **What I Discovered**

* **Free dominates** — but paid stands out.

Over 90% of apps are free, yet paid apps consistently earn higher ratings.



* **Games and Family apps rule the Play Store.**

These two categories make up the bulk of apps, but niche categories like Medical \& Lifestyle score better on average ratings.



* **Bigger isn’t always better**.

Surprisingly, large-sized apps don’t always correlate with higher ratings.



* **Popularity feeds itself.**

There’s a strong link between installs and reviews — more downloads bring more feedback, which pushes apps even higher in visibility.



## **How I Did It**

**Data Cleaning**: Standardized inconsistent formats (like "1,000,000+" installs), handled missing values, and converted text into usable numbers.



**Exploratory Analysis**: Looked at distributions, averages, and outliers to understand the dataset.



**Visual Storytelling**: Created aesthetic and interactive-style plots (bar charts, donut charts, bubble plots, and even futuristic hexbin visualizations).



#### **Tools I Used:**



**Python** (Pandas for data wrangling, Matplotlib \& Seaborn for visualizations)



**Jupyter Notebook** for analysis \& documentation



**Git \& GitHub** for version control and collaboration



## **Why It Matters**

If you’re a **developer**, this analysis shows where opportunities lie — **niche categories with high ratings but fewer apps** could be your goldmine.



If you’re a **marketer**, understanding the balance between **free vs paid strategies** could guide your pricing model.



If you’re just curious, well… now you know why your favorite apps are so popular.
